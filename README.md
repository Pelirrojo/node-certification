## About this repo

Every file contains one or more exercise for a particular node topic, like buffer, domain, cluster and so on.
All the exercises are organized by folders for each of the concepts covered in the exam.

To try it out, just launch it with node in the following way:

```bash
$ node src/08-Clustering_and_Multi-Process/buffers
```

or use the interactive menu:

```bash
$ npm start
```

And watch the output and later open files to study the code :)

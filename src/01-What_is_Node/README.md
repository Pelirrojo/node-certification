# What is node?

Node.js is a platform built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. The exam will test your basic understanding of Node’s architecture, its main components (APIs, bindings, V8 and libuv), and how they interact.

* [libuv: cross platform asynchronous I/O for Node](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)
* [APIs](http://nodejs.org/api)

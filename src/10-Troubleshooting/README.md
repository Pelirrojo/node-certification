# Name of section

It is important for Node developers to have an understanding of what development tools are at their disposal and how to leverage them. For the purposes of the exam, you should have a general understanding of the following tools:

* Debugging: Understanding the built in [debugger](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v0.12.x/api/debugger.html) and [Node inspector]()
* Memory leak detection: [Using event listeners](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v0.12.x/api/events.html) to catch memory leaks
* [Using REPL](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v0.12.x/api/repl.html): A Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) is available both as a standalone program and easily includable in other programs. The REPL provides a way to interactively run JavaScript and see the results. It can be used for debugging, testing, or just trying things out.
